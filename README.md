# Job Portal Interface – Candidate Journey

## 🚀 Overview
This project is my submission for the **UI Developer Evaluation Task**.  
I chose **Option A: Candidate Journey - Job Discovery Experience**, because I wanted to focus on creating an engaging job search and application flow for users.  

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions
1. **Modern Layout** – Used a card-based design for job listings with clear hierarchy.  
2. **Clean Navigation** – Added a simple navbar with search and filtering options for easy discovery.  
3. **Responsive Design** – Built with a mobile-first approach using Flexbox and CSS Grid.  
4. **User Feedback** – Added hover effects, button states, and basic form validation.  
5. **Color Palette & Typography** – Chose a professional color scheme with clear font hierarchy.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** – For building reusable UI components  
- **CSS** – For styling and responsive layouts  
- **Netlify** – For deployment
