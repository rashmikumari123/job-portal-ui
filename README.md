# 🌟 Job Portal UI – Candidate Journey

## 🚀 Overview
This project is my submission for the **UI Developer Evaluation Task**.  
I chose **Option A: Candidate Journey – Job Discovery Experience** to focus on creating an engaging job search and application flow for users.  
It demonstrates a **modern, responsive UI** built with React, with clean navigation and an intuitive layout for job discovery.

## 🎨 Key Features
- **Interactive Job Listings** – Card-based layout for jobs with hover effects and button states.  
- **Search & Filter** – Users can search and filter job listings easily (static in current version, ready for API integration).  
- **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first design using Flexbox and CSS Grid ensures compatibility across devices.  
- **User Feedback** – Hover effects, active button states, and basic form validation improve UX.  
- **Professional Styling** – Thoughtful color palette and typography for readability and aesthetic appeal.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** – For building reusable UI components.  
- **CSS (Flexbox & Grid)** – For styling.
- **Netlify** – For deployment and hosting.
